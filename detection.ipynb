The GO bond, carrying an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035, last traded at 64.74 points in price, pushing the yield to 13.05 percent from 12.73 percent on Thursday, according to data provided by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. According to the MSRB\\u2019s Electronic Municipal Market Access database, about $21 million worth of bonds traded versus $14 million the day before. Late on Thursday the House passed the \\\"Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act\\\" (PROMESA), by a vote of 297-127, with the U.S. Senate expected to take up the bill quickly ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due July 1. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Puerto Rico has a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a staggering 45 percent poverty rate. It faces steady migration of its residents to the mainland and a potential humanitarian crisis because it cannot sustain social services. PROMESA, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, would establish a powerful seven-member federal Oversight Board to navigate through the restructurings. Among other things, the board would have the authority to enforce balanced budgets. \\u201cIt is definitely a step forward, a very good step forward. We think it was necessary. It doesn\\u2019t answer all your questions but at least it sets up a framework and does provide fiscal management and oversight which we think was necessary because the credibility of the government is pretty much shot,\\u201d said Joe Rosenblum, director of municipal credit research at AllianceBernstein in New York. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t think at these prices we are ready to dip our toes back in and we haven\\u2019t seen a lot of trading activity out there, so I think we are in company,\\u201d Rosenblum said. PROMESA does not set out specific rules for restructuring, leaving such decisions to the control board to work through with creditors. This is a critical point for municipal bond market investors where long-standing rules set out a hierarchy among creditors, typically with GO bondholders considered senior to all others. \\u201cRegardless of how things get restructured today, the fact that the economy continues to shrink and the population continues to shrink is a problem for the credit going forward,\\u201d said Craig Brandon, co-director of municipal investments at Eaton Vance in Boston. \",\n          \"BERLIN (Reuters) - None of the German parties involved in exploratory coalition talks support French President Emmanuel Macron s idea to create a separate budget for the euro zone, a negotiator for the Greens party told Reuters on Wednesday. Reinhard Buetikofer, who participated in a late-night negotiating session on European policy on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP), said the Greens supported the idea of more investment in infrastructure but not a new budget.  None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament said.  We Greens fully support the idea of finding ways, within the framework of the existing EU budget, to boost investment in infrastructure. We share Macron s aim of increasing investment.  The news is a blow to Macron, who has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. The Greens are seen as the biggest supporters of Macron s ideas among the German parties considering a coalition.  \",\n          \"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warning against the danger of  sleepwalking  into war, said on Thursday that Security Council resolutions on North Korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries. Guterres made the comments to reporters after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo just days after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions. The White House said Wednesday that no negotiations could be held with North Korea until it improves its behavior. The White House has declined to say whether President Donald Trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward Pyongyang, gave approval to Tillerson s overture.  It is very clear that the Security Council resolutions must be fully implemented first of all by North Korea but by all other countries whose role is crucial to ... achieve the result we all aim at, which is the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,  Guterres said. Guterres added that Security Council unity was also vital  to allow for the possibility of diplomatic engagement  that would allow denuclearisation to take place.  The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war that might have very dramatic circumstances,  he said. Japan says now is the time to keep up maximum pressure on Pyongyang, not start talks on the North s missile and nuclear programs. China and Russia, however, have welcomed Tillerson s overture.  Abe, who spoke to reporters with Guterres, reiterated that dialogue needed to be meaningful and aimed at denuclearisation.  We fully agreed that the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is indispensable for the peace and stability of the region,  Abe said. Tillerson s overture came nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that put the entire United States mainland within range. In September, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido,  the second to fly over Japan in less than a month. North Korea appears to have little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved. United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, who visited Pyongyang last week, said on Tuesday senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks, but he believes he left  the door ajar .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dec 6, 2016\",\n          \"May 25, 2016\",\n          \"April 30, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The GO bond, carrying an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035, last traded at 64.74 points in price, pushing the yield to 13.05 percent from 12.73 percent on Thursday, according to data provided by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. According to the MSRB\\u2019s Electronic Municipal Market Access database, about $21 million worth of bonds traded versus $14 million the day before. Late on Thursday the House passed the \\\"Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act\\\" (PROMESA), by a vote of 297-127, with the U.S. Senate expected to take up the bill quickly ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due July 1. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Puerto Rico has a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a staggering 45 percent poverty rate. It faces steady migration of its residents to the mainland and a potential humanitarian crisis because it cannot sustain social services. PROMESA, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, would establish a powerful seven-member federal Oversight Board to navigate through the restructurings. Among other things, the board would have the authority to enforce balanced budgets. \\u201cIt is definitely a step forward, a very good step forward. We think it was necessary. It doesn\\u2019t answer all your questions but at least it sets up a framework and does provide fiscal management and oversight which we think was necessary because the credibility of the government is pretty much shot,\\u201d said Joe Rosenblum, director of municipal credit research at AllianceBernstein in New York. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t think at these prices we are ready to dip our toes back in and we haven\\u2019t seen a lot of trading activity out there, so I think we are in company,\\u201d Rosenblum said. PROMESA does not set out specific rules for restructuring, leaving such decisions to the control board to work through with creditors. This is a critical point for municipal bond market investors where long-standing rules set out a hierarchy among creditors, typically with GO bondholders considered senior to all others. \\u201cRegardless of how things get restructured today, the fact that the economy continues to shrink and the population continues to shrink is a problem for the credit going forward,\\u201d said Craig Brandon, co-director of municipal investments at Eaton Vance in Boston. \",\n          \"BERLIN (Reuters) - None of the German parties involved in exploratory coalition talks support French President Emmanuel Macron s idea to create a separate budget for the euro zone, a negotiator for the Greens party told Reuters on Wednesday. Reinhard Buetikofer, who participated in a late-night negotiating session on European policy on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP), said the Greens supported the idea of more investment in infrastructure but not a new budget.  None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament said.  We Greens fully support the idea of finding ways, within the framework of the existing EU budget, to boost investment in infrastructure. We share Macron s aim of increasing investment.  The news is a blow to Macron, who has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. The Greens are seen as the biggest supporters of Macron s ideas among the German parties considering a coalition.  \",\n          \"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warning against the danger of  sleepwalking  into war, said on Thursday that Security Council resolutions on North Korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries. Guterres made the comments to reporters after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo just days after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions. The White House said Wednesday that no negotiations could be held with North Korea until it improves its behavior. The White House has declined to say whether President Donald Trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward Pyongyang, gave approval to Tillerson s overture.  It is very clear that the Security Council resolutions must be fully implemented first of all by North Korea but by all other countries whose role is crucial to ... achieve the result we all aim at, which is the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,  Guterres said. Guterres added that Security Council unity was also vital  to allow for the possibility of diplomatic engagement  that would allow denuclearisation to take place.  The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war that might have very dramatic circumstances,  he said. Japan says now is the time to keep up maximum pressure on Pyongyang, not start talks on the North s missile and nuclear programs. China and Russia, however, have welcomed Tillerson s overture.  Abe, who spoke to reporters with Guterres, reiterated that dialogue needed to be meaningful and aimed at denuclearisation.  We fully agreed that the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is indispensable for the peace and stability of the region,  Abe said. Tillerson s overture came nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that put the entire United States mainland within range. In September, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido,  the second to fly over Japan in less than a month. North Korea appears to have little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved. United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, who visited Pyongyang last week, said on Tuesday senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks, but he believes he left  the door ajar .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The GO bond, carrying an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035, last traded at 64.74 points in price, pushing the yield to 13.05 percent from 12.73 percent on Thursday, according to data provided by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. According to the MSRB\\u2019s Electronic Municipal Market Access database, about $21 million worth of bonds traded versus $14 million the day before. Late on Thursday the House passed the \\\"Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act\\\" (PROMESA), by a vote of 297-127, with the U.S. Senate expected to take up the bill quickly ahead of a $1.9 billion debt payment due July 1. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Puerto Rico has a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a staggering 45 percent poverty rate. It faces steady migration of its residents to the mainland and a potential humanitarian crisis because it cannot sustain social services. PROMESA, if passed by the Senate and signed into law, would establish a powerful seven-member federal Oversight Board to navigate through the restructurings. Among other things, the board would have the authority to enforce balanced budgets. \\u201cIt is definitely a step forward, a very good step forward. We think it was necessary. It doesn\\u2019t answer all your questions but at least it sets up a framework and does provide fiscal management and oversight which we think was necessary because the credibility of the government is pretty much shot,\\u201d said Joe Rosenblum, director of municipal credit research at AllianceBernstein in New York. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t think at these prices we are ready to dip our toes back in and we haven\\u2019t seen a lot of trading activity out there, so I think we are in company,\\u201d Rosenblum said. PROMESA does not set out specific rules for restructuring, leaving such decisions to the control board to work through with creditors. This is a critical point for municipal bond market investors where long-standing rules set out a hierarchy among creditors, typically with GO bondholders considered senior to all others. \\u201cRegardless of how things get restructured today, the fact that the economy continues to shrink and the population continues to shrink is a problem for the credit going forward,\\u201d said Craig Brandon, co-director of municipal investments at Eaton Vance in Boston. \",\n          \"BERLIN (Reuters) - None of the German parties involved in exploratory coalition talks support French President Emmanuel Macron s idea to create a separate budget for the euro zone, a negotiator for the Greens party told Reuters on Wednesday. Reinhard Buetikofer, who participated in a late-night negotiating session on European policy on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives and the Free Democrats (FDP), said the Greens supported the idea of more investment in infrastructure but not a new budget.  None of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  Buetikofer, a member of the European Parliament said.  We Greens fully support the idea of finding ways, within the framework of the existing EU budget, to boost investment in infrastructure. We share Macron s aim of increasing investment.  The news is a blow to Macron, who has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. The Greens are seen as the biggest supporters of Macron s ideas among the German parties considering a coalition.  \",\n          \"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warning against the danger of  sleepwalking  into war, said on Thursday that Security Council resolutions on North Korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries. Guterres made the comments to reporters after meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo just days after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions. The White House said Wednesday that no negotiations could be held with North Korea until it improves its behavior. The White House has declined to say whether President Donald Trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward Pyongyang, gave approval to Tillerson s overture.  It is very clear that the Security Council resolutions must be fully implemented first of all by North Korea but by all other countries whose role is crucial to ... achieve the result we all aim at, which is the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,  Guterres said. Guterres added that Security Council unity was also vital  to allow for the possibility of diplomatic engagement  that would allow denuclearisation to take place.  The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war that might have very dramatic circumstances,  he said. Japan says now is the time to keep up maximum pressure on Pyongyang, not start talks on the North s missile and nuclear programs. China and Russia, however, have welcomed Tillerson s overture.  Abe, who spoke to reporters with Guterres, reiterated that dialogue needed to be meaningful and aimed at denuclearisation.  We fully agreed that the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is indispensable for the peace and stability of the region,  Abe said. Tillerson s overture came nearly two weeks after North Korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that put the entire United States mainland within range. In September, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido,  the second to fly over Japan in less than a month. North Korea appears to have little interest in negotiations with the United States until it has developed the ability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved. United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, who visited Pyongyang last week, said on Tuesday senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks, but he believes he left  the door ajar .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1pjzvh5) puerto rico has a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a staggering 45 percent poverty rate. it faces steady migration of its residents to the mainland and a potential humanitarian crisis because it cannot sustain social services. promesa, if passed by the senate and signed into law, would establish a powerful seven-member federal oversight board to navigate through the restructurings. among other things, the board would have the authority to enforce balanced budgets. \\u201cit is definitely a step forward, a very good step forward. we think it was necessary. it doesn\\u2019t answer all your questions but at least it sets up a framework and does provide fiscal management and oversight which we think was necessary because the credibility of the government is pretty much shot,\\u201d said joe rosenblum, director of municipal credit research at alliancebernstein in new york. \\u201cwe don\\u2019t think at these prices we are ready to dip our toes back in and we haven\\u2019t seen a lot of trading activity out there, so i think we are in company,\\u201d rosenblum said. promesa does not set out specific rules for restructuring, leaving such decisions to the control board to work through with creditors. this is a critical point for municipal bond market investors where long-standing rules set out a hierarchy among creditors, typically with go bondholders considered senior to all others. \\u201cregardless of how things get restructured today, the fact that the economy continues to shrink and the population continues to shrink is a problem for the credit going forward,\\u201d said craig brandon, co-director of municipal investments at eaton vance in boston. \",\n          \"berlin (reuters) - none of the german parties involved in exploratory coalition talks support french president emmanuel macron s idea to create a separate budget for the euro zone, a negotiator for the greens party told reuters on wednesday. reinhard buetikofer, who participated in a late-night negotiating session on european policy on tuesday with german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the free democrats (fdp), said the greens supported the idea of more investment in infrastructure but not a new budget.  none of the participating parties support a euro zone budget,  buetikofer, a member of the european parliament said.  we greens fully support the idea of finding ways, within the framework of the existing eu budget, to boost investment in infrastructure. we share macron s aim of increasing investment.  the news is a blow to macron, who has called for the creation of a euro zone budget of several hundred billions of euros to help the single currency bloc cope with economic shocks. the greens are seen as the biggest supporters of macron s ideas among the german parties considering a coalition.  \",\n          \"tokyo (reuters) - u.n. secretary-general antonio guterres, warning against the danger of  sleepwalking  into war, said on thursday that security council resolutions on north korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by pyongyang and other countries. guterres made the comments to reporters after meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in tokyo just days after u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson offered to begin direct talks with north korea without pre-conditions. the white house said wednesday that no negotiations could be held with north korea until it improves its behavior. the white house has declined to say whether president donald trump, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward pyongyang, gave approval to tillerson s overture.  it is very clear that the security council resolutions must be fully implemented first of all by north korea but by all other countries whose role is crucial to ... achieve the result we all aim at, which is the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula,  guterres said. guterres added that security council unity was also vital  to allow for the possibility of diplomatic engagement  that would allow denuclearisation to take place.  the worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war that might have very dramatic circumstances,  he said. japan says now is the time to keep up maximum pressure on pyongyang, not start talks on the north s missile and nuclear programs. china and russia, however, have welcomed tillerson s overture.  abe, who spoke to reporters with guterres, reiterated that dialogue needed to be meaningful and aimed at denuclearisation.  we fully agreed that the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula is indispensable for the peace and stability of the region,  abe said. tillerson s overture came nearly two weeks after north korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm) that put the entire united states mainland within range. in september, north korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern japanese island of hokkaido,  the second to fly over japan in less than a month. north korea appears to have little interest in negotiations with the united states until it has developed the ability to hit the u.s. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, something most experts say it has still not proved. united nations political affairs chief jeffrey feltman, who visited pyongyang last week, said on tuesday senior north korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks, but he believes he left  the door ajar .  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

 un secretarygeneral antonio guterres warning against the danger of  sleepwalking  into war said on thursday that security council resolutions on north korea s nuclear and missile programs must be fully implemented by pyongyang and other countries guterres made the comments to reporters after meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe in tokyo just days after us secretary of state rex tillerson offered to begin direct talks with north korea without preconditions the white house said wednesday that no negotiations could be held with north korea until it improves its behavior the white house has declined to say whether president donald trump who has taken a tougher rhetorical line toward pyongyang gave approval to tillerson s overture  it is very clear that the security council resolutions must be fully implemented first of all by north korea but by all other countries whose role is crucial to  achieve the result we all aim at which is the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula  guterres said guterres added that security council unity was also vital  to allow for the possibility of diplomatic engagement  that would allow denuclearisation to take place  the worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war that might have very dramatic circumstances  he said japan says now is the time to keep up maximum pressure on pyongyang not start talks on the north s missile and nuclear programs china and russia however have welcomed tillerson s overture  abe who spoke to reporters with guterres reiterated that dialogue needed to be meaningful and aimed at denuclearisation  we fully agreed that the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula is indispensable for the peace and stability of the region  abe said tillerson s overture came nearly two weeks after north korea said it had successfully tested a breakthrough intercontinental ballistic missile icbm that put the entire united states mainland within range in september north korea fired a ballistic missile over the northern japanese island of hokkaido  the second to fly over japan in less than a month north korea appears to have little interest in negotiations with the united states until it has developed the ability to hit the us mainland with a nucleartipped missile something most experts say it has still not proved united nations political affairs chief

# Spam-News-Detection
This project presents the development and evaluation of a spam news detection system designed to identify and filter out misinformation from legitimate news content. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques to classify news articles accurately, addressing the growing challenge of spam and fake news in the digital age. A diverse dataset was utilized, comprising articles from reputable news sources and known misinformation sites. The data underwent thorough preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and removal of stopwords, followed by feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF and n-grams. Various machine learning models were evaluated, with a focus on Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
